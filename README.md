Driver drowsiness is a significant concern in road safety, leading to a substantial number of accidents and fatalities worldwide. To address this issue, a Driver Drowsiness Detection System using Computer Vision has been developed. This system employs computer vision techniques to monitor the driver's face and detect signs of drowsiness or distraction. The system's primary goal is to alert the driver and potentially prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. This report provides an overview of the system, its functionality, performance evaluation, and potential future enhancements.
